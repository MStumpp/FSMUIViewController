{"name":"FSMUIViewController","tagline":"","body":"FSMUIViewController is an UIViewController extended by Finite State Machine (FSM) functionality. It provides functionality to configure different states and then move between these states.\r\n \r\n## Configuration of States\r\n\r\nThis section discusses how to configuration of custom view controller states and fixed view controller states.\r\n\r\nEach fsm state definition consists of two different parts:\r\n* The identifier of the fsm state, which is defined by an arbitrary string, e.g. \"state1\". There is also a default state.\r\n* For each fsm state defined before, code to be executed in that state has to be assigned to some view controller state controlled by UIViewController.\r\n\r\nThe following view controller states are available:\r\n- tDidInitViewState\r\n- tDidLoadViewState\r\n- tWillAppearViewState\r\n- tDidAppearViewState\r\n- tWillDisappearViewState\r\n- tDidDisappearViewState\r\n- tWillUnloadViewState\r\n- tDidUnloadViewState\r\n\r\n### Configure an arbitrary State\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[self configureState:@\"state1\"] onViewState:tDidAppearViewState do:^{\r\n   ...do something\r\n}];\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Configure the default State\r\n\r\n```\r\n[[self configureDefaultState] onViewState:tDidAppearViewState do:^{\r\n   ...do something\r\n}];\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Moving between States\r\n\r\n### Move to a certain State\r\n\r\n```\r\n-(void)toState:(int)state;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo nothing, if you are already in that state.\r\n\r\n### Move to the default State\r\n\r\n```\r\n-(void)toDefaultState;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo nothing, if you are already in that state.\r\n\r\n### Forced move to a certain State\r\n\r\n```\r\n-(void)toStateForce:(int)state;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo move, even if you are already in that state.\r\n\r\n### Forced move to the default State\r\n\r\n```\r\n-(void)toDefaultStateForce;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo move, even if you are already in that state.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
